Please load and follow the guidelines in @docs/react-router.md

Focus on:
- File-based routing conventions (dot notation, $params)
- Rendering modes (CSR/SSR/SSG)
- Check react-router.config.ts for current mode
- CSR vs SSR patterns (browser APIs, loaders)
- Route organization (thin routes, delegate to modules)
